== chwink
We have always been eager to show my 3 year old daughter stuff that she would never know by the time she is 15!!

She will not know what button phones are!
She may not know what is 'cable TV'
She will not know that Indian Rupee was ever Rs. - she would only know the symbol!
This got me thinking about why we cannot have a portal that helps us maintain a directory of things with time-lines on them - that would be fun, informative and nostalgic! Thats when "Chwink" happened - I realized there are some blog posts on the internet with a list of items that are now obsolete but there is no portal where people can share, discuss and collaborate.

CHildren WIll Never Know
